            ANCS is the premier forum for presenting and discussing original research that explores the relationship between the algorithms and architectures of data communication networks and the hardware and software elements from which these networks are built. ANCS focuses on architectures for networking and communication in the broad sense, including novel architectures, architectural support for advanced communication, algorithms and protocols for advanced architectures, software and applications for next-generation networking architectures, co-design of computer and network systems, and methodology and benchmarking for evaluating advanced communication architectures. ANCS 2021 will be held online.

             

            ### Call for Papers


            The conference seeks an emphasis on the applicability and feasibility of approach, and will prioritize implementation and measurement-led submissions. Authors are invited to include artifacts and data sets as part of their submission, and those would be looked  favourably by the committee. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Disaggregated computing</li>

                <li>Hardware offloading and accelerators</li>
                <li>Domain-specific languages</li>
                <li>Operating systems and virtualization</li>
                <li>Algorithms</li>
                <li>Switch/router/middlebox/NIC designs</li>
                <li>SDN/NFV systems</li>
                <li>In-network computing</li>
                <li>Host networking</li>
