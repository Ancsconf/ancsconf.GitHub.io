          <p><h3>Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment</h3>
          Discrimination and harassment are not to be tolerated within our community. All SIGCOMM events and communications
          (emails, online social network groups, etc.) must abide by ACM policy against discrimination and harassment (see
          <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment">here</a> for a comprehensive description of
          the policy). If a violation of this policy occurs, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event chairs or the
          ACM President, CEO, or COO. SIGCOMM recognizes that reporting to the conference chairs or an upper-level ACM
          administrator can be intimidating, especially in the face of an already traumatic experience.</p>
          <p>The SIGCOMM CARES Committee (SIGCOMM Committee to Aid REporting on discrimination and haraSsment policy violations)
          is intended to assist members of our community who may have experienced or witnessed behaviors that violate the
          ACM policy against discrimination and harassment at an event sponsored by the SIG. It was created following
          ACM SIGARCH initiatives and leveraging the experience with an ad hoc committee in SIGCOMM 2018. Note that despite
          CARES, for the matter to be reported, the person experiencing the incident must still themselves submit the complaint
          to ACM, where it will be handled according to ACM's policy.</p>
          <p>CARES committee members can help by providing advice on how to approach such a situation and ensuring it is investigated by ACM.
          They are available to listen and help anyone who has either experienced or witnessed discrimination and harassment
          at an event promoted by the SIG, or needs counseling on how to handle it. However, note that CARES is not intended to
          replace ACM's guidelines for reporting incidents, and such reporting remains the responsibility of the SIG member
          who experienced or witnessed the incident (a CARES committee member may, under exceptional circumstances, report
          an incident on behalf of a SIG member, but the member remains responsible for corroborating the facts with ACM).</p>

          <p><h3>Privacy Policy (from ACM)</h3>
          The link <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/privacy-policy">here</a> contains the ACM Privacy Policy, which
          applies to SIGCOMM, its members and all the conference's
          sponsors (including ANCS). ACM, SIGCOMM and conference organizers are committed to protecting the privacy of
          all conference attendees, members and non-members. The web site linked above explains how ACM and SIGCOMM use
          and maintain the privacy of personal information collected online in connection with the conference.</p>

          <p><h3>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
          The link <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">here</a> explains the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
          Conduct, which applies to SIGCOMM, its members and all the conference's sponsors (including ANCS).</p>
